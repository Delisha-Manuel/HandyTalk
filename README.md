Did you know ASL is the third most common language in the world, after English and Spanish? Globally, over 1.5 billion people have some form of hearing loss, with 430 million having disabling hearing loss. This means daily activities like conversations with friends are inaccessible to millions of people!

That’s why I created HandyTalk — a web app that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify ASL letters formed by human hands and display them on a screen, 
allowing everyone to enjoy the psychological benefits of conversations.
